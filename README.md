## Design Choices

### 1. **Component-Based Architecture**

The app is organized into smaller, reusable parts called components. For example, components related to `claims` and `policies` are kept in separate folders. This makes the code easier to maintain and reuse in the future.

### 2. **State Management with Redux Toolkit**

Redux Toolkit helps manage data (state) in the app without writing too much extra code. Using `slices` keeps related data and functions together, making it easier to track and debug how the data changes.

### 3. **TypeScript for Type Safety**

TypeScript ensures that variables, functions, and components are used correctly by checking for errors during development. All the appâ€™s types are stored in one folder `(types/)` to keep things consistent and organized.

### 4. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**

Tailwind CSS lets you add styles quickly using predefined classes directly in your components. It reduces the need to write custom CSS and keeps the design consistent throughout the app.

### 5. **Responsive Design Principles**

The app is designed to work well on different screen sizes. Tailwind's responsive features and component design make this possible.

### 6. **Routing with React Router**

React Router handles navigation in the app, making it easy to move between pages or views. All the routing logic is stored in one folder (routes/) to keep it organized.

### 7. **Testing with Jest and React Testing Library**

Jest and React Testing Library are used to test the app.

### 8. **Mock API with JSON Server**

The project uses a simple file `(db.json)` to act like a backend.

### 9. **Utility Functions**

Common functions used in multiple places are kept in one file `(utils/helpers.ts)`. This avoids repeating the same code and makes the app easier to manage.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+)
